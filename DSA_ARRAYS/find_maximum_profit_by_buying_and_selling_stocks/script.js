// Problem Description
// You have an array in which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

// Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit by buying a share on one day and selling it on another day. You may repeat this across the days (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

// Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again)

// Input format
// First line contains N, the number of days for which stock price will be provided

// Next line contains N space separated integers representing the stock prices on each of these N days

// Output format
// Print out the maximum profit possible. Print 0 if no profit is possible.

// Constraints
// 1 <= N <= 10^5

// 1 <= Stock prices <= 10^5

// Sample Input 1
// 6

// 7 1 5 3 6 4

// Sample Output 1
// 7

// Explanation 1
// Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.

// Again buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

// Total profit of 7.

// Sample Input 2
// 5

// 1 2 3 4 5

// Sample Output 2
// 4

// Explanation 2
// Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.

// Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you cannot engage in multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

// Sample Input 3
// 5

// 7 6 4 3 1

// Sample Output 3
// 0

// Explanation 3
// No profit is possible due to continuously decreasing prices, so the maximum profit is 0.
